<p class="Default">In this assignment, you will research and recommend two printers for a small medical reporting agency. The medical reporting agency knows nothing about printers (i.e., which ones to purchase or how to install or configure them). The medical reporting agency needs to print not only standard documents but also high quality photograph images and graphical reports on legal, executive, and standard size paper. The medical reporting agency also needs to be able to scan photographs and documents at high resolution. The printer should also have wireless capability for their wireless users.

<p class="Default">The medical reporting agency has set aside $2,500.00 for the two printers. However, the monthly budget for paper and ink should be no more than 20 cents per page (see the “Try This” on page 608 of your course textbook).

<p class="Default">Conduct the necessary research to find two printers that meet the medical reporting agency’s needs. In a one- to two-page APA formatted paper, provide the following:

<p class="Default">

<p class="Default"><strong>1</strong>. Include the make and model of the printers that you would recommend.

<p class="Default">2. Identify if the printers are laser, dye-sublimation, thermal, or inkjet, and explain why you made the choice or choices you did.

<p class="Default">3. Discuss the capabilities or characteristics of the printers as well as the price.

<p class="Default">4. Discuss how your printer choices would benefit the consulting agency.
